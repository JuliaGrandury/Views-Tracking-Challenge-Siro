We won't make you implement any tests for this challenge, 
but we still want to see how you think about testing your code. 

If you WERE to implement tests for your function, what cases would you test?

List each case below in plain english with it's expected result. 

For example...
Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time
Expected Result: etc etc


Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time
Expected Result: user b's uniqueRecordingViewCount and recording x's uniqueViewCount increase by 1

Case: user a views user b's recording x for the second time
Expected Result: user b's uniqueRecordingViewCount and recording x's uniqueViewCount remain the same

Case: user a views user b's recording x on two or more devices at the same time for the first time
Expected Result: user b's uniqueRecordingViewCount and recording x's uniqueViewCount still only increase by 1

Case: a non existing user views user b's recording x (no viewerId)
Expected Result: a 400 error is thrown because the viewerId doesn't exist

Case: user a views a recording that doesn't exist (no RecodingId)
Expected Result: the database remains the same as the recording doesn't exist
